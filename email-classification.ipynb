Make sure the equipment is clean and in the same excellent condition as when you received it.\n\nShould you face any issues with the equipment during the rental period, please contact the customer support team right away. They will either assist you with troubleshooting or arrange for a replacement if needed.\n\nRegarding insurance for the rented equipment, the company provides equipment protection plans that cover accidental damage but not loss or theft. If you didn't add this protection during the initial checkout process, it might not be possible to add it retroactively. However, I recommend checking with the rental location for any potential options.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your kind words and for choosing our equipment rental services.

In this situation, I would suggest reaching out to the company's customer support team as soon as possible. They have the expertise to help you troubleshoot the problem and provide potential solutions to stabilize the audio mixer levels.\n\nShould the issue persist even after attempting the suggested troubleshooting steps, the customer support team can arrange for a replacement if required.\n\nWhen the time comes to return the equipment, ensure you return it to the same location where you picked it up during their operating hours. It's essential to clean the items and return them in the same condition as when you received them.\n\nIf you need to cancel your reservation, you can do so up to 48 hours before the rental start time for a full refund. However, cancellations made within 48 hours may incur a cancellation fee.\n\nFor future rentals, you can visit their website, select the desired equipment, choose your rental dates, and complete the checkout process. Alternatively, you can visit their physical store or contact their customer service for assistance.\n--------------------\n\nProcessing email from customer4@example.com\nContent: When are your business hours?\nSending email to customer4@example.com\nSubject: Your Email Has Been Received\nBody: Thank you for your email.
